## Installation

Recommended and easiest way to installing library is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

`composer require azimolabs/apple-sign-in-php-sdk`

## Requirements

* PHP 7.1+
* OpenSSL Extension

## PHP support
|PHP version|Library version|
|---|---|
|`5.x`|`NOT SUPPORTED`|
| `> 7.0 <= 7.3`| `1.4.x` |
| `> 7.4 < 8.0`| `1.5.x` |

## How it works

This description assumes that you already have
generated [identityToken](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationsinglesignoncredential/3153080-identitytoken)
. Remember that token is valid ONLY for 10 minutes.

The first step to verify the identity token is to generate a public key. To generate public key `exponent` and `modulus`
values are required. Both information are exposed in [Apple API endpoint](https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys). Those
values differ depending on the algorithm.

The second step is verification if provided `identityToken` is valid against generated public key. If so we are sure
that `identityToken` wasn't malformed.

The third step is validation if token is not expired. Additionally it is worth to check `issuer` and `audience`,
examples are shown below.

## Basic usage

Once you have cloned repository, make sure that composer dependencies are installed running `composer install -o`.

```php
$validationData = new ValidationData();
$validationData->setIssuer('https://appleid.apple.com');
$validationData->setAudience('com.azimo');

$appleJwtFetchingService = new Auth\Service\AppleJwtFetchingService(
            new Auth\Jwt\JwtParser(new \Lcobucci\JWT\Token\Parser(new \Lcobucci\JWT\Encoding\JoseEncoder())),
            new Auth\Jwt\JwtVerifier(
                new Api\AppleApiClient(
                    new GuzzleHttp\Client(
                        [
                            'base_uri'        => 'https://appleid.apple.com',
                            'timeout'         => 5,
                            'connect_timeout' => 5,
                        ]
                    ),
                    new Api\Factory\ResponseFactory()
                ),
                new \Lcobucci\JWT\Validation\Validator(),
                new \Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Rsa\Sha256()
            ),
            new Auth\Jwt\JwtValidator(
                new \Lcobucci\JWT\Validation\Validator(),
                [
                    new \Lcobucci\JWT\Validation\Constraint\IssuedBy('https://appleid.apple.com'),
                    new \Lcobucci\JWT\Validation\Constraint\PermittedFor('com.c.azimo.stage'),
                ]
            ),
            new Auth\Factory\AppleJwtStructFactory()
        );

$appleJwtFetchingService->getJwtPayload('your.identity.token');
```

If you don't want to copy-paste above code you can paste freshly generated `identityToken`
in `tests/E2e/Auth/AppleJwtFetchingServiceTest.php:53`
and run tests with simple command `php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/E2e`.

```shell script
$ php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/E2e
PHPUnit 9.2.5 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.
